## 📋 **QUESTIONNAIRE ANSWERS**

### 1. **Downloaded App Content**
**Question:** Does the app contain any ratings-relevant content (e.g., sex, violence, language) downloaded as part of the app package (code, assets)?

**✅ Answer: NO**
- **Reason:** JERK Tracker X is a restaurant order tracking app with no inappropriate content, violence, sexual content, or profanity in the app package.

---

### 2. **User Content Sharing**
**Question:** Does the app natively allow users to interact or exchange content with other users through voice communication, text, or sharing images or audio?

**✅ Answer: NO**
- **Reason:** The app is designed for restaurant order management and QR code tracking. Users do not interact with each other through the app - it's a business tool, not a social platform.

---

### 3. **Online Content**
**Question:** Does the app feature or promote content that isn't part of the initial app download, but can be accessed from the app? Examples: movies in Netflix, product listings in Amazon, songs in Spotify, AI content, or news articles.

**✅ Answer: NO**
- **Reason:** The app connects to AWS DynamoDB for order data storage and retrieval, but does not stream movies, music, news, or access external content libraries. All content is user-generated order data.

---

### 4. **Promotion or Sale of Age-Restricted Products or Activities**
**Question:** Does the app focus on promoting or selling items or activities that are typically age-restricted such as cigarettes, alcohol, firearms, or gambling?

**✅ Answer: NO**
- **Reason:** The app is for Jamaican food delivery and restaurant order tracking. While it may handle orders for restaurants that serve alcohol, the app itself does not promote or sell age-restricted products - it's a logistics tool.

## 🔧 **MISCELLANEOUS QUESTIONS**

### 5. **Location Sharing**
**Question:** Does the app share the user's current and precise physical location with other users?

**✅ Answer: NO**

**Question:** Does the app allow users to purchase digital goods?

**✅ Answer: NO**
- **Reason:** No in-app purchases, subscriptions, or digital goods. The app is free to use.

### 7. **Rewards & Cryptocurrency**
**Question:** Does the app include cash rewards, gift cards, play-to-earn features, convertible cryptocurrency rewards, or the issuance of transferable digital assets (e.g., NFTs)?

**✅ Answer: NO**
- **Reason:** No rewards system, cryptocurrency, NFTs, or play-to-earn mechanics. It's a straightforward business application.

---

### 8. **Web Browser/Search Engine**
**Question:** Is the app a web browser or search engine?

**✅ Answer: NO**
- **Reason:** The app is a specialized restaurant order tracking tool, not a general web browser or search engine.

---

### 9. **News/Educational Product**
**Question:** Is the app primarily a news or educational product?
