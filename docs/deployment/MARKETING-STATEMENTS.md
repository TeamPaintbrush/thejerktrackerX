## 📋 FAQ Responses

**Q: How does this stop fraud?**
A: Every order gets a unique QR code. When the driver scans it, we record who picked up the order, exactly when, and from where. This creates undeniable proof that the driver took possession of the food. When customers falsely claim they never received their order, you have timestamped evidence.

**Q: What if the driver doesn't scan?**
A: Don't hand over the food until they scan. It takes 2 seconds and protects you. Make QR scanning mandatory - it's your fraud prevention insurance policy.

**Q: Does this work with DoorDash, Uber Eats, etc.?**
A: Yes! It works with ANY delivery service. Your delivery drivers, DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub - anyone picking up food scans the QR code.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Plans start at $29/month. Most restaurants save that much preventing just ONE fraudulent claim. It literally pays for itself.

**Q: Is it hard to set up?**
A: Not at all. Download the app, create your restaurant account, and start creating orders. No special hardware, no complicated training. If you can use a smartphone, you can use The Jerk Tracker X.
